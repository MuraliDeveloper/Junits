Minimum levels of software testing:
-----------------------------------
Testing phase requires to do different types of testing.

1.Unit Testing                     (white)    -> Dev
2.Integration testing              (white)    -> Dev/QA
3.System testing                    (black)   -> Tester 
4.UAT (User Acceptance testing)    (black)   -> Tester/Customer








White box testing:- Dev
-------------------
-test the internal working or code.
- test the code by writing the test cases.
-done by developers by understanding the coding.
- focus on code coverage
-test based on coding point of view.
ex: unit testing + integration testing.
dev has to write Junits test cases using code.



1.Unit Testing:
---------------
 - Tested by Dev
 - write code to test the code
 - Testing is not on the product functionality  ;
 testing is only on the code written by the developer.

ex: if we have login requiremnets:
we need write 4 functions (dev)

Dev:
------------- 
-> input()  
-> validate()
-> process()
-> showResponse()

unit testing:
---------------
->input() 
      -> test the input() funtion by writing test cases 
->validate()
       -> test the validate() funtion by writing test cases  
->process()
        -> test the process() funtion by writing test cases  
->showResponse()
         -> test the showResponse() funtion by writing test cases  

frameworks used for unit Testing:
----------------------------------------
Junits 
Mockito
EasyMock
RestEasy
Apache HttpClient
